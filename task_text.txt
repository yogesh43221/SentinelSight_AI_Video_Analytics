Assignment: Build “SentinelSight” — AI Video Analytics Platform (2-Day Sprint) 
Deadline 
Submission deadline: Sunday, 11 January 2026 — 6:00 PM IST 
Time budget: ~2 days total. Build as much as possible; prioritize a working end-to-end 
system. 
 
1) Objective 
Build a working MVP of a multi-camera video analytics platform that: 
1. Ingests CCTV streams (at least 1–2 RTSP sources) 
2. Runs computer vision inference (object detection + simple rules) 
3. Generates events/alerts 
4. Shows results in a web dashboard + exposes APIs 
5. Is structured to scale (multi-camera, multi-model, modular pipelines) 
This should follow best practices seen in modern platforms: 
• VMS + centralized multi-site camera management (e.g., Milestone)  
• Analytics modules for review/respond/research concepts (e.g., BriefCam’s 
module framing)  
• AI alerts + accelerated search style experiences (e.g., Avigilon)  
• Local-first privacy approach + zones + event messaging (e.g., Frigate with 
MQTT/events and local processing)  
 
2) Mandatory Scope (Must-Haves) 
A. Video Ingestion 
• Support RTSP camera streams (minimum: 1, target: 4+). 
• Each stream is treated as a “Camera” entity with: 
o name, location tag, RTSP URL, status (online/offline), FPS (approx), last 
frame time 
• Auto-reconnect on failure. 
B. Inference & Analytics 
--- Page 2 ---
Implement at least one of these model paths: 
• Object detection (people/vehicle) using any standard model (YOLO family, 
Detectron, etc.) 
• Optional: simple tracking (IDs across frames) if time permits 
Analytics logic (minimum): 
• Zones (draw polygon/rectangle zones per camera) 
• Rule engine (at least 2 rules): 
1. Intrusion: person enters restricted zone 
2. Loitering: person remains in zone > N seconds 
• Generate events containing: 
o camera_id, timestamp, rule, object_type, confidence, bounding boxes, 
snapshot path 
C. Event Store + API 
• Persist events in a database (SQLite acceptable for MVP). 
• Provide REST API endpoints: 
o GET /cameras 
o POST /cameras (add RTSP stream) 
o GET /events?camera_id=&from=&to=&rule= 
o GET /events/{id} 
o Optional: GET /health, GET /metrics 
D. Dashboard (UI) 
A simple web UI that shows: 
• Camera list + status 
• Live preview (best effort; even periodic frames is ok) 
• Event feed (filter by camera/rule/time) 
• Event details view with snapshot + metadata 
• Zone editor (even a basic JSON input is acceptable; GUI drawing is bonus) 
E. Packaging / Run Instructions 
• Repo with clean structure 
--- Page 3 ---
• README with setup steps 
• Ideally dockerized (bonus but strongly preferred) 
 
3) “Freedom to Add Features” — Suggested Enhancements (Choose as many as you 
can) 
You are encouraged to research global products and add features beyond the MVP . 
Examples inspired by real systems: 
VMS-like capabilities (Milestone-style) 
• Multi-site grouping / tags (“Dubai – Site A – Floor 3”) 
• Role-based permissions (Admin/Operator/Viewer) 
• Camera onboarding wizard, export/import camera configs  
Analytics modules framing (BriefCam-style) 
Build features that map to: 
• Review: post-incident search/filtering 
• Respond: real-time alerts 
• Research: trends/heatmaps/counters over time  
AI-Driven Operations (Avigilon-style) 
• “Attention required” alert view (reduce information overload) 
• Faster review: timeline scrub + event jump navigation  
Local-first + event messaging (Frigate-style) 
• MQTT / Webhook event publishing 
• Config-driven rules (YAML/JSON) 
• Clip recording around event (pre/post seconds)  
Performance / scaling best practices (optional) 
If you explore acceleration stacks like OpenVINO or DeepStream, document what you 
tried: 
• Latency vs throughput settings (OpenVINO performance hints)  
• Handling multiple RTSP streams / runtime stream management (DeepStream 
runtime stream patterns)

4) Architecture Guidance (Recommended) 
You can implement any architecture, but it should be understandable and extensible. 
Recommended MVP architecture 
• ingestion-service: pulls RTSP , decodes frames 
• inference-service: runs model and emits detections 
• rules-engine: zones + rules → events 
• api-service: stores and serves events/cameras 
• ui: dashboard 
For a 2-day build, this can be a single monorepo service, but keep modules separated. 
 
5) Deliverables (What to Submit by the Deadline) 
Required 
1. Git repo with code 
2. README including: 
o How to run 
o How to add a camera stream 
o How to test (even minimal) 
o Known limitations + next steps 
3. Demo script (1 page max): 
o What to click 
o What to show in 3–5 minutes 
4. Research & Best Practices Notes (mandatory) 
o 1–2 pages describing: 
▪ 3 global platforms you studied (e.g., 
Milestone/BriefCam/Avigilon/Frigate)  
▪ Features you adopted 
▪ Features you would add next + why

Optional (highly valued) 
• Docker Compose 
• Short screen recording (2–4 minutes) 
• Postman collection / OpenAPI spec 
 
6) Evaluation Criteria (How Your Work Will Be Scored) 
1) Working End-to-End System — 35% 
• Can we add a camera and see it “working”? 
• Are events generated reliably? 
• Does the UI reflect reality (camera status, event feed)? 
2) Engineering Quality — 20% 
• Clean architecture, modularity, readability 
• Error handling, retries, logging 
• Sensible defaults + configuration approach 
3) Product Thinking & Feature Depth — 15% 
• Features beyond MVP that clearly improve usability 
• Operator-friendly UX decisions (filters, views, speed of reviewing incidents) 
• Thoughtful event schema and search 
4) Performance & Stability — 10% 
• Handles multiple streams reasonably 
• Doesn’t crash on a broken stream 
• Basic metrics (FPS per camera, queue sizes, inference time) = strong bonus 
5) Security, Privacy, Compliance Mindset — 10% 
• Data minimization approach (store events/snapshots vs full video) 
• Access control (even simple), audit trail (bonus) 
• Clear notes on GDPR-safe patterns and what is not implemented 
6) Research & Best Practices Adoption — 10% 
• Clear evidence you studied real systems and extracted patterns 
--- Page 6 ---
• Explicit mapping: “We adopted X because… ” 
• Mature roadmap thinking 
Bonus Points (up to +15%) 
• Dockerized deployment 
• MQTT/webhooks integration 
• Exportable event clips 
• Heatmaps / trend charts 
• Multi-tenant or role-based access control 
• OpenAPI docs + decent test coverage 
 
7) What to Highlight in the Final Discussion (Mandatory Talking Points) 
1. What you built end-to-end and what’s still stubbed 
2. Your architecture choices (and tradeoffs under 2-day constraints) 
3. How you researched existing platforms and what you adopted 
4. What you’d do next with 2 more weeks (scaling, multi-model, storage, search, 
permissions)
